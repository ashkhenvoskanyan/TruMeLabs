                            For the best results please make sure you're well hydrated. Collect a small amount of saliva
                            in the clean spoon, and then transfer a small amount of saliva in each circle of your sample

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p data-i18n="accordion-item.answer3">To determine your true Biological age TruMe scientists are
                            measuring the levels of DNA methylation within specific DNA regions. Methylation of DNA
                            occurs on cytosine residues, especially on specific small DNA regions called CpG islands.
                            These regions are usually clustered around genes and can affect their activity. Methylation
                            of CpG islands by DNA methylases has been shown to be associated with gene inactivation and
                            plays an important role in the development of cancer and cell aging. Reversal of DNA
                            methylation at these sites is a potential therapeutic strategy as this reversal may restore
                            gene expression and as the result improve physiological function of the organism.
                            The methylation status of a DNA sequence can best be determined using bisulfite conversion.
                            Bisulfite treatment of the target DNA results in conversion of unmethylated cytosine
                            residues into uracil, leaving the methylated cytosines unchanged. Therefore, bisulfite
                            treatment gives rise to different DNA sequences for methylated and unmethylated DNA that can
                            be easily detected by sequencing.
                            In the lab we sequence 9 small regions of your DNA, and analyze how methylated your DNA is.
                            This information is further analyzed by our algorithm to determine how old you really are.
                            Please note, we do not sequence your whole genome. We also do not store your saliva sample
                            or your DNA. All biological material or DNA sequence data is deleted after our test is
                            completed.</p>

                            called CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments). If you use the TruAge data for
                            diagnostic purposes, you should always contact the doctor and have the results confirmed by

                            Sometimes TruMe reports an inaccurate Biological age. This usually happens when we do not
                            isolate a sufficient amount of DNA from your sample. Or, if the sample is contaminated. The
                            contamination usually happens when customs didn’t dry sample enough and we see bacterial or
                            mold overgrowth on the filter paper. If you see what you think is an error, please feel free
                            to contact us. Also, keep in mind that these are initial results. As people continue to join
                            we will continue to update and improve your testing accuracy.</p>

                            identification number into our internal registration system. As soon as a sample has been
                            scanned, it undergoes its first test — a visual inspection to make sure the sample is not
                            contaminated or too wet. Occasionally a sample will not pass this step, and we immediately
                            contact the customer and ship a replacement kit so he or she can spit again. If a sample
                            passes the visual inspection, it is time for DNA extraction and bisulfite conversion to
                            differentiate your methylated and unmethylated DNA. Then, the small regions of your DNA are
                            extracted and sequenced to quantify a percentage of your DNA methylation. We are using
                            independent laboratory services to perform all sequencing procedures.
                            Once a sample has been successfully analyzed, the laboratory sends the resulting data to
                            TruMe along with the barcode that came with the sample. This allows us to return the
                            information to the proper account and begin interpreting your data. Please note, TruMe does
                            not need to know your date of birth to be able to calculate your biological age. Yet, we
                            would like to know your date of birth, your life style, your general health status, and your
