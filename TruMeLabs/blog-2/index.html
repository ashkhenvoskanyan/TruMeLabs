                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No secret here, being happy can make you live a longer healthier
                        life!<strong> Easier said than done huh?</strong></span></p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the science of a smile has been proven many times, we know and
                        fully understand that keeping a happy attitude is becoming increasingly harder. We've had a
                        pandemic, an economic collapse and many other aspects of life making the day to day a more
                        stressfull experience. BUT just as being happy is a scientifically proven method to stay young,
                        <strong>here we will list the scientifically proven ways to biohack your way into feeling
                            happy!</strong></span></p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first, let's talk about the hormones your body produces to make
                        you feel this way:<strong> among them are endorphins,</strong> which are released in response to
                        pain or stress and produce a sense of euphoria; <strong>dopamine</strong>, which is involved in
                        the brain's reward system and helps to regulate emotions;<strong> and serotonin</strong>, a
                        neurotransmitter that regulates mood and social behavior. It is thought to play a role in
                        depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders!</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let's talk about 5 simple things you can do to improve your happy
                        hormone levels, and thus improve your health:</span></p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Get a good night's sleep:</strong> Most people are
                            aware of the importance of getting a good night's sleep, but many do not realize the full
                            extent of the impact that sleep deprivation can have on the body. When we don't get enough
                            sleep, our bodies produce more stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones
                            are designed to help us deal with short-term stressors, but when they are produced in
                            excess, they can lead to feelings of anxiety and paranoia. Sleep deprivation can also cause
                            serotonin levels to drop, which can further contribute to feelings of depression and
                            anxiety. Fortunately, there are things we can do to reduce our stress hormone levels and
                            increase our serotonin levels. Exercise and relaxation techniques like yoga or meditation
                            can help to reduce the production of stress hormones, while spending time in nature and
                            exposure to natural light can help to boost serotonin levels. Getting enough sleep is an
                            important part of managing stress levels, but it is only one piece of the puzzle.</span>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <ol start="2">
                    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Eat healthy foods:</strong> Serotonin and dopamine are
                            neurotransmitters that play important roles in the brain. Low levels of these chemicals have
                            been linked to depression and anxiety. Therefore, it makes sense that certain nutrients that
                            help to boost levels of serotonin and dopamine may also help to improve mood. Omega-3 fatty
                            acids, magnesium, and vitamin D are all thought to have mood-boosting properties. Omega-3
                            fatty acids are found in fish and other seafood, as well as in nuts and seeds. Magnesium is
                            found in leafy green vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. Vitamin D is found in
                            fortified milk and orange juice, as well as in fatty fish. Including these nutrients in the
                            diet may help to improve mood and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <ol start="3">
                    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Exercise:</strong> There is a growing body of evidence
                            that suggests that physical activity can have a positive impact on mental health. One way
                            that exercise may improve mood is by increasing levels of neurotransmitters such as
                            serotonin. Exercise has been shown to increase levels of serotonin, which may help to
                            improve mood. Additionally, exercise can also help to reduce stress and anxiety, which can
                            further improve mood. Therefore, there are several ways that physical activity can help to
                            increase levels of neurotransmitters and improve mood.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <ol start="4">
                    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Connect with others:</strong> Social interaction is
                            known to have a positive effect on our mental and emotional health. In fact, studies have
                            shown that social interaction can result in higher levels of serotonin and dopamine, two
                            important chemicals that help to regulate our mood. The act of interacting with others
                            releases these chemicals into our system, which helps to improve our mood and reduce stress
                            levels. Additionally, social interaction helps to keep our mind active and engaged, which
                            can help to prevent cognitive decline. Furthermore, interacting with others provides us with
                            a sense of belonging and support, which can be essential in times of need. Ultimately,
                            social interaction is vital for our mental and emotional wellbeing.</span></li>

                <ol start="5">
                    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Reduce stress:</strong> According to the American
                            psychological Association, stress is a normal part of life that can be both positive and
                            negative. Positive stress, also known as eustress, can motivate us to meet a deadline or
                            perform well in an important event. Negative stress, on the other hand, occurs when we feel
                            overwhelmed or unable to cope with demands. Chronic stress can lead to serious health
                            problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Fortunately, there are a
                            number of simple ways to reduce stress in our daily lives. Exercise, for example, is a great
                            way to reduce stress levels. Just 30 minutes of moderate exercise can help to improve mood
                            and increase energy levels. Other effective stress-busters include relaxation techniques
                            such as yoga or meditation, spending time with friends and family, and getting regular
                            breaks from work. By taking steps to reduce stress, we can improve our physical and mental
                            health.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, there are a number of simple lifestyle changes that
                        can help to improve mood and reduce stress levels. Getting enough sleep, exercise, and eating a
                        healthy diet are all great ways to boost serotonin levels and improve mood. Additionally, social
                        interaction and reducing stress can also help to improve mental health. By making these changes,
                        we can improve our overall wellbeing.</span></p>
